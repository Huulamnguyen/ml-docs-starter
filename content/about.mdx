## üë®‚Äçüî¨ Who Am I

Hi, I‚Äôm **Lam Nguyen ‚Äî a PhD researcher in Computer Science** at the **New York Institute of Technology (NYIT)** and the creator of **MLDocs**. My research focuses on behavioral biometrics, continuous user authentication, and the application of machine learning algorithms to real-world problems involving posture, movement, and haptic interaction.

At the **LAMP Lab (Laboratory for Behavioral Authentication, Machine Learning, and Privacy)**, I apply models such as **SVM, Random Forest, KNN, GMM, and Neural Networks** to study the robustness of **biometric authentication systems**. My recent publication explored how posture and body movement affect smartphone-based authentication ‚Äî a step forward in understanding behavioral biometrics under dynamic conditions.

Before transitioning into research, I gained industry experience as a **Software Engineer** at **Silicon Valley Bank**, where I worked on enterprise-level applications using **React, TypeScript, and CI/CD pipelines**. I also contributed as a **React Developer at Forward Impact Enterprises** and served as a **Data Analyst at Adelphi University**, combining data processing skills with a strong understanding of statistical analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Why do I create MLDocs

I created MLDocs to give learners a single, accessible platform where they can build a strong foundation in machine learning ‚Äî drawing from real research, practical experience, and trusted educational resources.

My goal is to foster an open learning environment where knowledge is approachable, community-driven, and rooted in both academic rigor and practical relevance.
